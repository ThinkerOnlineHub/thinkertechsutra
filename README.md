## 🚀 About Thinker TechSutra Marathi 🌐 (Marathi Tech Learning | टेक आणि तंत्रज्ञान समजून घ्या सोप्या भाषेत)

**Thinker TechSutra Marathi** is a dedicated learning initiative founded by **Prafulla Sagavekar**. The mission is to bridge the gap between complex technology and regional language learners by simplifying 

**PlatformOps, DevOps, Linux, and CloudOps** concepts in Marathi.

### 🎯 Mission & Vision

As a self-learner in the DevOps space, I realized that while the demand for IT skills is high, high-quality, structured technical content in Marathi is scarce. This platform aims to:

* **Demystify Tech:** Break down complex CI/CD, Automation, and Infrastructure concepts into easy-to-understand Marathi.

* **Empower Careers:** Provide clear roadmaps and practical guidance for Marathi-speaking students to become job-ready in Cloud and DevOps roles.

* **Bridge the Language Gap:** Remove the "fear of English" in tech by focusing on logic, commands, and hands-on practicals.

### 📚 What I Share

* **Linux Mastery:** From basic terminal navigation to advanced permissions and system administration.

* **DevOps & PlatformOps:** Real-world workflows involving CI/CD, Monitoring, and Automation tools.

* **Cloud Infrastructure:** Fundamentals of AWS (Compute, Storage, Networking) and Infrastructure as Code.

* **Learning in Public:** Documenting my personal journey to inspire others to start their own tech career transitions.
